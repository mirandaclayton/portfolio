    <p> I’m Miranda, a creative and vibrant designer with a background in fine art and art education. I love solving problems and I especially love to make things. I’m especially skilled in presenting, project management, and writing. I have been reskilling into tech, with a particular interest in UX Design and Front-End Development, through certifications and coursework in UX Design, coding, and data analytics. I am eager to bring my artistic flair and problem-solving skills to the tech industry.</p><br>
